## Who am I

Hi, I'm 草原. I'm a python programmer with a passion for programming, food, and quantitative trading. I'm here to share my experience and insights and hope to connect and learn from as many people as possible.

## My experience

When you are deep in every field, you will always meet some people and encounter some things. These people, these things will make us feel that it is too much of a pity to be dispersed with the wind, so be it. In a quiet corner, leave some traces. Looking forward to the arrival of a person of destiny, get what you need. Also let these people, these things in the memory of more people.

## My mission

I believe that people are born free. I believe that knowledge has value only when it is diffused. This is what we should all strive for. My mission is to realize these values through my work and lifestyle, and to help more people find their own mission and values.
